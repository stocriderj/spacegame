                A generic, all-rounder frigate designed by the United Federation. Outfitted with just two UF-R76-1 generic 76mm cannons and two UF-aC36-1 36mm autocannons, each with one the upper deck and one on the keel, this ship's damage output is rather laughable, but it makes up for it with extremely cheap manufacturing costs and a decent cruising speed.
            UF301 â€” A small, basic engineering vessel.
            Weaponry - 1xUF-aC36-1
            Attack: 2
            Hull: 30
            Speed: 75
            Cost: 1000
            Actions: Mine, Build
            Storage: 1000

RESOURCES
    Irium (E-ree-am), extremely versatile metal, universal currency
    Iridite, mined from Irioids

BUILDINGS
    Smelter, smelts 2 iridite into 1 irium
    Irium Micro-Universe Gateway (IMUG), Allows instantaneous transport of Irium to and from the quantum Irium micro-universe (QIMU). Utilizing the unique properties of Irium, it folds it up into 10 dimensions, allowing it to be stored in a quantum micro-universe accessable from anywhere in the 3D universe, where it can then be unfolded by an IMUG into 3 dimensions to be used again.


METRICS
    Warp Speed: in lightminutes/second
    Cruise Speed: in megameters/second
    Hull HP: in HIMR (Hull Integrity Measurement Rating), a universal measurement for hull measurement
    Attack Damage: in HIDR (Hull Integrity Damage Rating), or HIMR dealt per volley.
    Cost: in Irium
    Storage: in m3 cubed
